# Bloom
We believe that nothing can replace human interaction, that is why we created Bloom, a different kind of social network that makes it easier to safely meet new people in person. 

## Explore
In Bloom, exploration is key, users can see what people around them are sharing, react to their posts and engage in conversation. Follow people and have their posts appear in your personal timeline.

To add someone to your network, both users have to set up a meet and be in close proximity of each other. Just bring your phones together and accept the friend request. 

Afterwards, many new features will be enabled to interact with your new friend, including chat.

## Meet
We encourage people to explore their surroundings and interact with people near them, some of the interactions include commenting, liking and sharing posts.

The option to meet people will pop up once both of them have enough public interaction.

To meet a new person users have to meet certain requirements, the option will only be available if:

- Both users have interacted publicly.
- Both users have a good reputation.
- Both users have accumulated at least 5 hours of usage.

If the user meets these requirements, they will be able to send a meet request.

A meet request consists of a specific time and place, once a request is sent, the recipient has to accept, if this happens, both user will require to share the meet with at least one person.

If for any reason you can't make it, you can let the other person know why and the option to set up another meet will be available.

## Security
We recognize that meeting new people in person is always a risk, for this reason, we count with a reputation system that can warn you of any potential danger when meeting someone new.

When you decide to meet someone, you will be presented every bit of information we can so that you can be prepared.

Before you meet someone, you will have the option to share the meet with anyone, whether or not they are in the app, ensuring that if anything happens, someone will have your back.

If you consider that the behavior of the person you met was inappropriate, you can always open a report to let other users know what happened and prevent them from meeting that person.

In the interest of keeping you secure and preventing any further incidents, the reported user will never know a report was opened by you.

Depending on the gravity and quantity of reports accumulated by a user, we may decide to terminate the user's account indefinitely.

## Privacy
We know that people online are not always nice, so, we offer various ways to limit what you see.

### Keyword blocking
You can add keywords to prevent posts containing them to ever show up in your timeline.

### User blocking
Users can be blocked, once this happens this user will no longer be able to contact you in any way

### Post flagging
You can flag a post as inappropriate and prevent others from encountering it, this way we can all help each other have a pleasant experience while browsing the world.

Once enough posts for a particular user are marked as inappropriate, we will intervene and review the account, if the posts are not considered inappropriate after being reviewed, the account will remain open, otherwise it will be closed indefinitely.
